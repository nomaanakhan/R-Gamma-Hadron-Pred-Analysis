# R-Gamma-Hadron-Pred-Analysis
I'm trying to predict whether the particles are Gamma or Hadron on the Magic04 data set. 

My first data set is a collection of data gathered about a bike sharing program in Portugal. It has data abou the number of casual and registered users each day for two years, it also has data about the weather, temperature, humidity, windspeed, and whether that day was a holiday. 
My target variable is cnt which is total number of bikes used which includes both registered and casual users. I want to predict the number of users depending on various attributes, this prediction can be us eful for the company to calculate the number of bikes they need on any particular day. I have performed linear regression and kNN classification on the data set.

The logistic model has an accuracy of 79.9158780231335%.

kNN classification has an accuracy of 80.62949%.
